# colorpicker

This is a practice project on basic front-end technologies.

There are 3 sliders for RED, GREEN and BLUE colours with scale from 0 to 255 (as usual). Sliding them mixes the 3 primary colours 
to show the generated colour in the background. Also RGB-code and HEX-code of the generated colour is displayed.

The CSS is made screen-size compatible but some features can run only in Google Chrome ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢.
